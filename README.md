# Chrome-API-for-Safari
Make an extension for Safari and Chrome with same code.

Actually, this is write for my own extension project. So there still some code need to be modified.
I will fix it after few days.

This project is base on 
https://github.com/kritollm/chrome-extension-api-for-safari-and-firefox

TODO :
There isn't tab id in safari api
need to find out how to fix it.
